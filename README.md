# Console
Dictionary system controled by specifics console commands.

# Inspiration & Purpose
This program was build around 2016 as a dictionari controled by specifics console commands. The idea was implement all data structures, file format (to save and read the content of the dictionari) and, of course, the series of comands and subarguments for interact and modify the dictionary. It could be said this projects is the "father" of my most recent repository called Alvidir that actually is being build for the same purpose (just in a much more elegant & confortable way). In that time, that was a really funny way to experiment with the gotten knowledges at university.
